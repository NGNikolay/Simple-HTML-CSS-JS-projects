This is a repo where I am collecting simple projects that I've made from the net to practice and develope my coding skills

1. Roll-Dice-Simulator you can check here: https://dice-roll-sim.netlify.app

2. Space Invaders. You can check them here: https://space-invaders-basic.netlify.app
2.1 Have in mind:
- The game starst directly. The button is to restart it when it's over.
- You can move your spaceship with left and right arrow on the keyboard and shoot with the space button.
- The game is not phone friendly. :( (yet)
